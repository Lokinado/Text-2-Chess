# About The Project
Text-2-Chess is an fun side-project that leverages mathematical algorithms to translate written text into unique chess positions. This system sidesteps the use of AI, relying solely on the power of mathematical transformations to convert textual input into a visual chessboard representation. I also wrote a decoder function that is capable of extracting the text from the resulting image.

Have Fun! ðŸ˜„

## Build With
This project is designed to run in browser on users device.
* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
* [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
* [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

<br>

# Getting Started
Just visit the publicly available [DEMO](https://kbrw.pl/text2chess/) on my website. If you find my work interesting, I encourage you to read more on my homepage [kbrw.pl](https://kbrw.pl/).

<br>

# Usage
Simply visit [DEMO](https://kbrw.pl/text2chess/) and write your favourite string of text into the input field and generate your first chessboard! If you have screenshot of some chessboard you can try to crop it and try to read the hidden message. I need to mention that this functionality still needs some work. For more information read **Roadmap** section. 

### Alternatively

If you want to host it by yourself then you can. Simply clone this repo and then host it on any server capable of serving html,css and js files.


<br>

# Roadmap
I really want to add AI based image detection for this project. I have already decided what tools I want to use so stay tuned for future updates ðŸ˜„.
